Usually, we make a form with a single value, for example text or number or radio. At that time I was confused, when I made a checkbox, the value received in mysql was only one, even though the user entered more than one choice. Therefore, I researched how I could do it. enter the value that has been selected by users into mysql with the database. Finally i can do it with this way..
